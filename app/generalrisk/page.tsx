              <b>CFDS</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              CFD stands for “Contract For Difference,” meaning you are not
              buying the underlying asset, but, rather, purchasing a contract to
              settle the difference in the initial and ending price of the
              asset. When trading CFDs, you generally trade on margin, which
              means you only have to deposit a small percentage of the overall
              value of your position. This is known as “Leverage”, and even
              small market movements may have great impact, negative or
              positive, on your trading account.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss
              greater than the funds invested in a specific position. You are
              responsible for all losses in your account up to the equity in
              your account.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before deciding to trade on margin, you should carefully consider
              your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk
              appetite. Our CFDs are not listed on any exchange. CFDs involve
              greater risk than investing in on-exchange products, as market
              liquidity cannot be guaranteed and it may be more difficult to
              liquidate an existing position. The prices and other conditions
              are set by us in accordance with our obligation to provide best
              execution as set out in our order execution policy, to act
              reasonably and in accordance with the applicable Terms and
              Conditions. The characteristics of our CFDs can vary substantially
              from the actual underlying market or instrument. Full details of
              all of our CFDs are set out on our website. In respect of
              corporate events, with respect to the underlying assets, we do not
              aim to make a profit from our clients from the outcome of
              corporate events such as rights issues, takeovers, mergers, share
              distributions or consolidations and open offers. We aim to reflect
              the treatment we receive, or, would receive if we were hedging our
              exposure to you in the underlying market. Ultimately, however, you
              are not dealing in the underlying market and, therefore, in
              relation to our CFDs, the treatment you receive may be less
              advantageous than if you owned the underlying instrument.
            </p>

            <p>
              CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing
              money rapidly due to leverage. 67% of retail investor accounts
              lose money when trading CFDs with this provider. You should
              consider whether you understand how CFDs work, and whether you can
              afford to take the high risk of losing your money.
            </p>

            <p>
              CFDs are not suited to the long-term investor. If you hold a CFD
              open over a long period of time, the associated costs increase
              (such as overnight fees), and it may be more beneficial for you to
              buy the underlying asset instead. Sudden market movements, known
              as “gapping” may occur, causing a dramatic shift in the price of
              an underlying asset. Gapping may occur when the underlying market
              is closed, meaning the price on the underlying market may open at
              a significantly different level, and at a less advantageous price
              for you.
            </p>

            <p>
              At all times during which you have open positions, you must ensure
              that your account meets our margin requirements, which may change
              from time to time. Therefore, if our price moves against you, or
              if our margin requirements have changed, you may need to provide
              us with significant additional funds to meet your margin
              requirement at short notice, to maintain your open positions. If
              you do not do this, we will be entitled to close one or more or
              all of your positions and you alone will be responsible for any
              losses incurred as a result.

              of the information you provide us, any product or service is not
              appropriate. If you decide to continue and open an account with

            </p>

            <p>
              You should further ensure that you are able to monitor positions
              on your account at all times, as you are solely responsible for
              this. We are not responsible for monitoring positions on your

            <p>
              CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS ARE DETERMINED BY DEMAND AND SUPPLY ONLY.
              The Cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena and its respective
              prices are often highly unpredictable and volatile. The
              Cryptocurrency prices are usually not transparent, highly
              speculative and susceptible to market manipulation. In the
              worst-case scenario, the product could be rendered worthless.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is important to make a distinction between indicative prices
              which are displayed on charts and dealable prices which are
              displayed on our trading platform. Indicative quotes only give an
              indication of where the market is. Because Cryptocurrency markets
              are decentralised, meaning they lack a single central exchange
              where all transactions are conducted, each market maker may quote
              slightly different prices. Therefore, any prices displayed on any
              chart made available by us or by a third party will only reflect
              “indicative” prices and not necessarily actual “dealing” prices
              where trades can be executed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Cryptocurrency trading is prone to being misused for illegal
              activities due to the anonymity of transactions and investors
              would be adversely affected if law enforcement agencies were to
              investigate any alleged illicit activities.
            </p>

            <p>
              ACCORDINGLY, CRYPTOCURRENCIES SHOULD BE SEEN AS AN EXTREMELY
              HIGH-RISK ASSET AND YOU SHOULD NEVER INVEST FUNDS THAT YOU CANNOT
              AFFORD TO LOSE.
            </p>

            <p>
              Given the foregoing, Cryptocurrencies are not appropriate for all
              investors. You should not deal in these products unless you have
              the necessary knowledge and expertise, understand these products’
              characteristics and your exposure to risk. You should also be
              satisfied that the product is suitable for you in light of your
              circumstances and financial position. In addition, use of our
              Services can never be considered a safe investment, rather, only
              an investment with a high risk of loss inherently associated with
              them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, our own spread is added to online quotes which makes
              a trade on our websites even more volatile.
            </p>

            <p>
              The risk of loss in trading Cryptocurrencies can be substantial.
              You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is
              suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial
              resources. You should be aware that you may sustain a total loss
              of the funds in your account. If the market moves against your
              position, we may ask you to provide a substantial amount of
              additional margin funds on short notice, in order to maintain your
              position. If you do not provide the required funds within the time
              frame required by us, your position may be liquidated at a loss,
              and you will be liable for any resulting deficit in your account.
            </p>

              {project_name} currently allows trading in cryptocurrencies over
              the weekend and it reserves the right not to do so. Should{" "}
              {project_name} so elect, trading in cryptocurrencies shall be
              allowed only from Monday through Friday. Given that the
              Cryptocurrency exchanges may operate over weekends, there may be a
              significant difference between Friday’s close and Sunday’s open.
              All such factors may result in you either not completing an order
              on a specific trading day or completing an order on a
              substantially less favourable price.
            </p>

            <p>
              Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or
              impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example,
              when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit (“limit
              move”), if there is insufficient liquidity in the market. Certain
              crypto assets may carry additional or specific risks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Newly issued cryptocurrencies might carry additional risks you
              need to consider. Limited liquidity or difficulties to trade the
              asset after you’ve bought it. This means prices could be volatile,
              going up and down quickly, and liquidity may be limited, all
              depending on supply and demand. {project_name} cannot control
              these external factors.

              We may elect to execute any order and/or hold any fiat money and
              cryptocurrencies via a Third Party. Such Third Parties are not
              banks that hold their fiat money/virtual currency as a deposit. If
              any such Third Party loses any money, fails or goes out of
              business, there is no specific legal protection that covers you
              for losses arising from any funds you may have held with such a
              Third Party, even when such party is registered with a national
              authority. Depending on the structure and security of the{" "}
              {project_name} Money crypto wallet, some individuals may be
              vulnerable to hacks, resulting in the theft of virtual currency or

              <b>SPAC Risks</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Investing in SPACs carries different risks to investing in other
              stocks on {project_name}. Unlike other listed companies, SPACs are
              shell companies when they become public and, therefore, they do
              not have an underlying operating business. This means that you are
              relying on the managers of the SPACs to realise your investment.
              There is no guarantee that SPACs will be managed by individuals
              and firms that may not be competent or qualified to do so. You
              should read the SPAC’s IPO prospectus and any reports or other key
              information documents filed or published to understand the terms
              of your investments and the economic interests and motivations of
              the SPAC you are investing in. Moreover, SPACs that do not carry
              out an acquisition within a certain time period will be
              liquidated. As a result, there is a risk that you may not recover
              some or all of the money directly invested by you into the SPAC.
